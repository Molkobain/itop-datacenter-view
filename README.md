## How to
### Position a device on a rack
A quick example to show how to manually position a device on a rack.

In this example, the *Rack 2* has a *Server* attached but is listed among the *unmounted* devices. This is because the *server* has no *position* set.
![How to - Unmounted device](docs/mdv-howto-positionserver-01.png)

To fix this, edit the *server* and make sure it has both *position* and *rack units* (its height) set.
![How to - Edit device](docs/mdv-howto-positionserver-02.png)

Save the object and go back to the *rack*. The *server* will now appear in the *front* panel!
