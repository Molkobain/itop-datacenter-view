#### Drag & Drop
Drag & drop elements in the graphical view to easily set their position instead of manually editing each elements!
![Pro features - Rear panel](docs/mdv-profeatures-drag-01.png)

#### Complex enclosures support
Support any enclosure form factor with the grid layout. From vertical server-blades to devices with heterogeneous widths / heights. ü§©

Follow the wizard to design the layout...
![Pro features - Rear panel](docs/mdv-profeatures-gridlayoutwizard-01.png)

... then easily position your devices.

![Pro features - Rear panel](docs/mdv-profeatures-gridlayout-06.png)

#### Rear panel support
* Available in both racks and enclosures
* Automatically shows occupancy on the opposite panel

![Pro features - Rear panel](docs/mdv-profeatures-panels-01.png)

![Pro features - Occupancy rates](docs/mdv-profeatures-occuprates-02.png)

![Pro features - Occupancy rates](docs/mdv-profeatures-occuprates-01.png)

#### Power capacity
Keep an eye on your racks power consumption:
* Fill devices expected consumption
* Max. expected consumption on each rack & enclosure is automatically computed
* Compare it with contracted power and actual power reading

![Pro features - Rack power](docs/mdv-profeatures-rackpower-01.png)

#### Weight capacity
Keep an eye on your racks & enclosures weight capacity:
* Fill devices weight
* Cumulated weight on each rack & enclosure is automatically computed
* Compare it with the maximum weight allowed by the element itself or the server room specs

![Pro features - Rack weight](docs/mdv-profeatures-rackweight-01.png)

#### Consistency checks
Optional consistency checks are made on elements during creation / update:
* Overlapping elements
* Malpositioned elements (outside rack's / enclosure's grid)
* Total elements' height exceeds rack's / enclosure's capacity

![Pro features - Consistency checks](docs/mdv-profeatures-consistency-01.png)

#### Audit rules
Comes with a bunch of audit rules to keep your datacenter vision clear:
* Production elements should have position set when attached to a rack or enclosure
* Positioned elements should be attached to a rack or enclosure
* Positioned elements should have *Rack units* attribute set
* Positioned elements should not overlap another one
* Positioned elements should not be outside its rack's or enclosure's (exceed height or malpositioned)

![Pro features - Audit rules](docs/mdv-profeatures-audit-01.png)

#### Reserved slots
Two new object classes to better describe your racks and enclosures:
* ReservedSlot: Reserve space in a rack / enclosure for any future usage or element.
* MiscEquipmentSlot: Mark space as used for patch panel or cable management for example.

![Pro features - Reserved slots](docs/mdv-profeatures-reservedslots-01.png)

#### Custom classes
You have some custom classes _(not derivating from DatacenterDevice)_ that you would like to use in racks and enclosures? No problem! Just register them in the `custom_device_classes` config. parameter, make sure they have the required attributes _(see documentation)_ and they will automatically appear. üëå

#### Zero-U devices
Manage devices with non standard size / positioning such as USB drives, vertical PDUs, non rackable devices, ... Just mark them as such to make them appaer in the bottom-right panel of their host, easy as pie!

![Pro features - Zero-U devices](docs/mdv-profeatures-zerou-01.png)

#### Misc. options
* Us order: Reverse Us order per rack / enclosure to fit your set-up
* Enclosure layout: Either display enclosure's elements or just the number of elements in it
* Custom colors: Change the colors of each element types in the configuration editor

## How to
### Free version (molkobain-datacenter-view)
#### Position a device on a rack
A quick example to show how to manually position a device on a rack.

In this example, the *Rack 2* has a *Server* attached but is listed among the *unmounted* devices. This is because the *server* has no *position* set.
![How to - Unmounted device](docs/mdv-howto-positionserver-01.png)

To fix this, edit the *server* and make sure it has both *position* and *rack units* (its height) set.
![How to - Edit device](docs/mdv-howto-positionserver-02.png)

Save the object and go back to the *rack*. The *server* will now appear in the *front* panel!
![How to - Result](docs/mdv-howto-positionserver-03.png)

#### Paid version (molkobain-datacenter-view-extended)
_Under construction_
